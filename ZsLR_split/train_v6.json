Today, it is known that the high cholesterol content of butterfat makes it harmful to human health. Since the public should be encouraged to eat foods with lower rather than higher butterfat content and since the term \"imitation\" with its connotations of falsity deters many people from purchasing products so designated, manufacturers who wish to give reduced-butterfat butter the more appealing name of \"lite butter\" should be allowed to do so.",

            "Most people deterred from eating \"imitation butter\" because of its name choose alternatives with a lower butterfat content than this product has.",

            "The manufacturers who wish to call their product \"lite butter\" plan to change the composition of the product so that it contains more water than it now does.",
            "The manufacturers who prefer to use the word \"lite\" instead of \"imitation\" are motivated principally by the financial interest of their stockholders."

These leases were supposed to have included a provision that reinstates the royalties should the market prices of oil and gas exceed a certain level. Because of an error by the federal government, however, the language that reinstates the royalties is missing from the more than 1, 100 leases issued by the U. S. government in 1998 and 1999.

In response, the government is pressuring the oil companies to renegotiate the leases.

It follows that melon plants have a lower-than-usual rate of photosynthesis when their roots are in rain-soaked soil.

It is commonly thought that this happens because <b> aging by itself brings about a loss of creative capacity </b>. However, a study has found that almost all scientists who produce highly creative work beyond the age of forty entered their fields late and less than a dozen years before their creative breakthroughs. Since <b> creative breakthroughs by scientists under forty also generally occur within a dozen years of the scientist' s entry into the field </b>, the study' s finding strongly suggests that the real reason why scientists over forty rarely produce highly creative work is not due to age but rather because most have spent too long in their fields.",
